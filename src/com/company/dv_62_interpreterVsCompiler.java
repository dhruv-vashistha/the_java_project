        interpreter translates one line at a  time
        compiler translates the whole file and then store as .exe file
        by the way java is a hybrid language
        it converts the source code to byte code (which is compilation)
        and then byte code to machine code (which is interpretation)
        we share the byte code which makes the java platform independent
        we can do it with the help of the powershell too however we will do it with vs code editor
        terminal<new terminal<write javac (class name).java  --for compilation
        and terminal<new terminal<write java (class name)   --for interpretation
